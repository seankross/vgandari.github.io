I've written some software tools to benefit the aerospace community,
students, and people in general.
I've provided convenient links below, and organized projects by 

## The Computational System Design Language (CSDL)

[Link to Documentation](https://lsdolab.github.io/csdl/)

From FAQ:

> CSDL is an embedded domain specific language designed for solving
> Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) problems.
> CSDL enables complete separation between specifying a mathematical
> model and implementing a numerical simulation of a physical system.
> Separation between specification and implementation enables engineers
> to operate at a high level of abstraction, without the need to
> implement low level algorithms, including derivative computation. CSDL
> is an obvious choice for optimization problems that benefit from
> gradient-based methods because of how CSDL automates derivative
> computation, both at the level of individual operations, and across
> tightly coupled disciplines. The CSDL compiler's intrusive design
> makes it a powerful tool for analyzing, verifying, and optimizing
> model code prior to execution, so it is sure to grow in capability in
> the long term, reducing development time.


## Tree of Knowledge

[Link to GitHub Page](https://github.com/vgandari/tok)

Description:

Tree of Knowledge is a command line utility (`tok`) for organizing
existing notes into a well-structured document for review.
The command line utility takes a configuration file as input and
generates [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files.
The configuration file specifies which concepts a user would like to
review.
Each concept is contained within its own file with the text that will
appear in the final document, as well as dependency relationships
between the concept and other concepts.
The `tok` command line utility then searches for all of the relevant,
necessary concepts for the user to review, sorts them in an intuitivea
way, compiles the content, and outputs Rmarkdown files.
Once the Rmarkdown files are generatee,
[Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) can use to generate a nicely formatted
website.
